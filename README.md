"One of the proposals of the final CS50 project is to create something that impacts your community, and it was with this premise that the SafraCode idea came up"

### Proposal:

I grew up in Fund√£o - ES, and the main economic activity in the municipality is coffee growing, so the proposal with SafraCode was to create a web application MPV to assist in free financial control of coffee crops, aimed at small producers, using a simple layout and with essential information for financial control of the crop.
